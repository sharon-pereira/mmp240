              <h3> Queens Community College</h3>
              <h2> Digital Art and Design </h2>
              <h4> Degree: A.S. </h4>
              <p>The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry.
              </p>

<p>Digital Art and Design students should take ARTS-192 and ET-710 as Writing Intensive course requirements. </p>
              
             <p>  Specifically, the program provides students with:

· knowledge of current widely used programs in the design field

· proficiency in operating these programs

· understanding of the means and methods of mass (production of artwork using these programs)

· skills for working with and understanding the computer and the technical problems associated with operating a computer

· knowledge based on awareness of the importance of aesthetic judgment in making design decisions. </p>
